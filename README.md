King of the Hill scripts


These are some tips/tricks I usually do

First thing I do when I get into the machine is deleting ssh keys and put mine

To generate id_rsa & id_rsa.pub you could use ssh-keygen

Then, enter the machine using `ssh -i id_rsa remote_username@remote_host` 

using this simple trick only you can enter the machine using ssh...

To automate putting ur username inside king.txt and make sure that there's no username except yours,u can create a simple script to do that 

```
#!/bin/bash
while :
do
        eval "echo [usernameHere] >> /root/king.txt"
        eval " > /root/king.txt"
done

#this script is created in 1 min :P
```
or by simpler way
```
while [[ $(cat /root/king.txt) != "[usernameHere]" ]]; do echo "[usernamehere]" >> /root/king.txt; done

#this script is created in less than minute :P

```

also u can add your username automatically by putting inside /etc/crontab

`* * * * * echo "[usernameHere]" >> /root/king.txt >/dev/null 2>&1`
